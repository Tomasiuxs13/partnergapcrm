# NEEDS (G1-D)

Changes G1-D needs in files it does not own. G3-1 merges these (spec 5.5).

1. **`functions/api/clients/[k].js` (unowned, "[unchanged]" in 5.2): decode the key.**
   On `d5e91d9` (wrangler 4.40 local), `PUT /api/clients/botanical%20synthesis` returns 400 "Unknown client.".
   The route gets the raw `botanical%20synthesis` in `params.k`, and the old page sends `encodeURIComponent(k)`.
   So no program with a space in its key can be saved today, and T23 ("`field = 'botanical synthesis'`") cannot
   pass without a fix. Suggested one-line change: `const k = text(decodeURIComponent(String(params.k || "")), 40).toLowerCase();`
   (wrapped in try/catch for a malformed `%`). The row it must then write is `tests/e2e/golden/client-program.json#partial`
   with `field` = `"botanical synthesis"`. The golden file records the d5e91d9 400 as `key-with-space-d5e91d9-bug`.
